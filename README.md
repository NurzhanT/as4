# Graph Search Algorithms Assignment

Welcome to the Graph Search Algorithms Assignment repository. In this assignment, you will implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm for an edge-weighted graph where vertices are represented as objects. This approach promotes modularity and clarity in graph data structures and algorithms.

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of two fundamental graph search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm. The focus is on using vertex objects to represent graph vertices, providing a clear and structured way to handle graph operations.
Graph algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science, with applications ranging from network routing to social network analysis. In this assignment, we focus on two essential graph search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is a simple yet powerful algorithm used to traverse or search tree or graph data structures. Starting from a selected node, BFS explores all its neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. Unlike BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm can handle graphs with varying edge weights, making it suitable for more complex routing problems such as those found in geographic mapping and network routing.


## Notes


### Code Structure and Maintainability

- **Modularity**: The implementation separates different components (e.g., Vertex, WeightedGraph, Search, BreadthFirstSearch, DijkstraSearch) into distinct classes, promoting modularity and reusability.
- **Readability**: Use clear and meaningful variable names, and add comments to explain the logic and flow of the code.
- **Extensibility**: The structure allows for easy extension, such as adding more graph algorithms or modifying existing ones.

### Testing

- Test the implementation with various graph configurations to ensure correctness.
